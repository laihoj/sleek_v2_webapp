<h2>Research Ideas / angles</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Edge computing with real-time time series data stream</li>
	<li>Detectible gesture granularity - Gesticulation vs sign language vs keyboard keys </li>
	<li>Application level research - form factors, use cases</li>
	<li>Business research</li>
</ul>



<h3>The basic gist</h3>
<p>
	
<br>
	Given a stream of time-series data consisting of raw accelerometer and gyroscope readings at some sampling rate from multiple devices in motion, can we perform real-time classification all activities measured by said devices?
</p>

<br>
<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<br>

<ol>
	<li>An IoT infrastructure is suitable for achieving technical functionality</li>
	<li>Temporal convolutional networks are suitable for classifying inertial measurement time series data</li>
</ol>
